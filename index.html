                            Cluster sharding and Kafka-Journal maintainer.
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            As a maintainer of Akka Cluster Sharding based libs I implemented
                            state-transfer feature that allows shard rebalancing without requesting state from persistence.
                            This leads to increased rebalance throwput and lover load on persistence layer, 
                            reduced actor's offline time during rebalancing and flatten CPU spikes on shard startup. 
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            Replace Akka Persistence by implementing new persistence API and replacement of PersistentActor 
                            to work with new persistence API. The goal was in providing backpressure capability during recovery
                            (Akka Persistence is push-based while new API is pull-based) and smooth integration of Evolution
                            game logic (written in FP style) with the persistence. Later used as a basement for state-transfer 
                            feature.
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            As a Kafka-Journal mainteiner I superviced team contributions, documented some tricky parts,
                            improved data integrity and prepared plan for major architectural change: Kafka-Journal designed
                            as reliable persistent streaming system with additional index by key, making it query-afficient.
                            Streaming realiability guaranteed by using Kafka as a transport between an application and the DB,
                            also providing persistent streaming. That leads to no way for the DB to reject incomming data, making
                            an application fully responsible for data consistency.
                        </div>

                            RNG core team developer.
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            As a RNG (first-person games) core team I contibuted into game engine used as basement for 
                            first-person games: each game served by Akka Cluster Sharding application that keeps its state
                            in-memory (allowing reply < 10ms) and asyncronosly dumping changes into Kafka-Journal as events.
                            Due to my work games stop losing results of long-lasting calls to other systems, game teams got
                            much flexible API to define game logic, games can tolerate configuration changes without 
                            interupting gameplay (even in case of delayed processing that can take few days), created geo-based
                            routing for client connections (Evolution operates multiple clusters in different regions that 
                            serves same clients) and contributed to different Evolution OSS libs. 
                        </div>

                            Develop and bring to production Agent-Wallet service that provides tracking of agent limit changes
                            in real-time with strong guarantee of processing each bet no more than once. The service was later 
                            supported by other team without almost any changes for years.
